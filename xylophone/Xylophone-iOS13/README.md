This is an iOS app created in Xcode using Swift. This app allows the user to play the xylophone by pressing the coloured tiles on the screen, each tile having a different musical note. I was able to develop the app with the help of the course 'iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp'.
